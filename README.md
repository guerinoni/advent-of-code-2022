## Why this repo is here?

Just for fun and practice. I'm not a professional programmer, so I'm trying to improve my skills.
Sure some solution can be improved in time or space complexity, but I'm not going to do that.
I hope can be useful to someone else.

This is just for "measure" my skills at night and a way to see new problems and new solutions.
It was fun doing this in Go, not a language that I admire but it is fast to learn, awesome tooling
and it helps to make thing done.
